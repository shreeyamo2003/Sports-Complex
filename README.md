# Sports-Complex

I have developed a responsive webpage for a 'Sports Complex' as part of a college coursework project. The frontend is crafted using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring an engaging and user-friendly interface. For the backend, I utilized MySQL to handle database queries and connections, facilitated through PHP and XAMPP software.
